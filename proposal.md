# Proposal for new repositories

## jsmol-lab

jsmol-lab would be a custom implementation of the jsmol web app. It would contain the Jmol code in a child jsmol directory, but the jsmol.html web app would be in the repository directory. The web app would have an embedded console to encourage the user to use Jmol commands. Generally the user would clone the repository, open the web app page, and serve it with Apache. The user could then view, analyze, and create models. The repository would also contain some starter models and tutorials on how to use it for useful chemistry.
